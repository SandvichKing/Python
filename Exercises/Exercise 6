# Exercise 6: Display numbers divisible by 5 from a list
# Iterate the given list of numbers and print only those numbers which are divisible by 5

list = [10, 20, 33, 45, 55]
print("These numbers are divisible by 5")

# This uses the modulo operator % to determine if an index is divisible by 5, if there is no remainder, its divisible by 5.
for x in list:
    if x %5 == 0:
        print(x)
