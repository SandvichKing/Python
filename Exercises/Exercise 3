# Exercise 3: Print characters from a string that are present at an even index number
# Write a program to accept a string from the user and display characters that are present at an even index number.
# For example, str = "pynative" so you should display ‘p’, ‘n’, ‘t’, ‘v’.

# Get the string from user
str = input("Type in a word: ")
print("Original word is", str)
print("Printing only even index numbers")

# Store word as int for range function
# start: Start at index 0
# stop: use whole word
# step: incrementing in 2's

# Store the word as an integer using len(str)
str_length = len(str)
for i in range(0, str_length, 2):
    # Print the index and its corresponding letter
    print("Index:", i, "Letter:", str[i])

# Same exercise but with List Slicing method
print("Now with list slicing")
print("Original word is", str)
print("Printing only even index numbers")
# Store the word as a list
str_list = str
# List slicing, initial index: 0, end index:none, indexjumps:2
for x in str_list[0::2]:
    print("Letter:",x)
