# Exercise 4: Remove first n characters from a string
# Write a program to remove characters from a string starting from zero up to N and return a new string.

# Get word from user
# Parameters: Word (contains the word as a string), N (contains the index number)
def remove_chars(word, n):
    print('Original string:', word)
    # Using slicing technique
    x = word[n:]
    return x

# Perform the remove_chars function, with arguments "pynative" for paramater "word" and "4" for parameter "N"
print("Removing characters from a string")
print(remove_chars("pynative", 4))
print(remove_chars("pynative", 2))
