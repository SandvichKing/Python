# Exercise 1: Calculate the multiplication and sum of two numbers
# Given two integer numbers, return their product only if the product is equal to or lower than 1000. Otherwise, return their sum.

# Print result of Product or Sum
def multiplication_or_sum(number1, number2):
    product = number1 * number2
    sum = number1 + number2
    if product <=1000:
        return product
    else:
        return sum
    
# Condition 1
result = multiplication_or_sum(20, 30)
print("The result is", result)

# Condition 2
result = multiplication_or_sum(40, 30)
print("The result is", result)
